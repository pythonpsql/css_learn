<!-- 
    Element has content
    For section content is h1 tag(in the example)
    For h1 tag content is text
    Content has padding
    Padding has border
    Margin is not part of the element.
    There are two types of elements -- block level and inline

    We add padding of 20px to #product-overview
    Observe the images of h1 and section before and after padding
    There is no change in h1
    h1 always seen extended beyond the section because there h1 is shown inclusive of its margin
        you can remove padding, set h1 margin to 50px to verify this
    When padding of 20px is added to section #product-overview
        that padding is applied to content + margin of h1
        If we add padding, the content of the element is to be considered as
            content + any margin it may have
            padding is added after margin of child elements so that margin and padding do not overlap
    Now we add border and margin
        Adding margin overlaps section margin with that of body
    The margin of Choose your plan is now collapsed with #product-overview margin
        The larger margin among two adjacent block elements is applied
