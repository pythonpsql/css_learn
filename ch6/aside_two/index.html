<!--  
    .parent .child-1 { position: relative};
    no change at all
    top: 50px left:50px
    the child-1 moves
    for relative, positioning context is the element itself
    and the element is not taken out of document flow
    the element moves from its current position
        while calculation read as 'move from top 50px'
        so to move left, you have to set right value
    to avoid moving element out of the parent
        set overflow: hidden in the parent
        it hides elements which are outside of it
    however, if we use overflow:hidden on the body element,
    it by default gets passed to html element, so the overflow:hidden does not work
    if we remove overflow property from body and add it to html
    still there is no change
    we need to add it to both body and html to get it working as desired
    it works because now html already has overflow, so it does not get passed from body and stays with the body
