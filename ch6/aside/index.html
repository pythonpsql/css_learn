<!--  
    .parent .child-1 { position: fixed };
        the current position of child-1 gets fixed
        the child-2 shifts to the position of child-1
        so both occupy the same place now
        however, the width of child-1 is now like inline
        we can change the width of child-1, so it not an
            inline element, but an inline-block element
    { top: 100px}
    child-1 moves but it is not clear how it calculates 100px
        so we set it to 0px
        now, we see it move to the top, we remove its margin
            and then find it at the extreme top
            Conclusion: The viewport is its positioning context
    we set width to 100% and left to 0px
        child-1 extends beyond the right side of viewport
        we fix it by applying box-sizing: border-box;
    we can set child-1 inside a span instead of div
        there is no change which means position can be
            applied to block level or inline elements
