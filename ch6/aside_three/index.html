<!--
    we add position: sticky and top:20px to .parent .country
    sticky is a combination of relative and fixed
    like relative, there is no change if
        we only add position: sticky without top
    as soon as we reach a border, the element behaves as fixed 
    we can set a distance between a viewport and element, as soon as that distance is reached, it behaves fixed
    the parent has not impact except the end of content of parent
    sticky is new property and the browser support is not perfect
