<!-- Changes made after zero.html:
    In the head section:
        1. title
              will appear as tab name in the browser
        2. link
              specify a relationship with 'rel' (type of content)
              specify a HyperText Reference with 'href' (path)
    In the body section:
        1. <main>
        The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.
        The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. 
        It should not contain any content that is 
            repeated across documents such as 
            sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
        Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document. 
          The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.
        2. <section>

        The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as 
          chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.  
        section usually needs to immediately have a heading inside it
        section indicates a key area of the page -- that is the only major point of consideration in deciding whether to use section or div
        3. <h1>
          It is inside section in this file  -->
