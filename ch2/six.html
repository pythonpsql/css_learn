<!-- 
Changes made after five.html
    all h1 elements will have their style applied if we use h1 selector
    if we do not want this behaviour, one of the options is to use class 
    class name will be given inline to the element using class="<classname>"
    it the css file the selector will be .<classname>
    universal selector (*): applied to all elements on the page
    id selectors are unique (idname is not repeated unlike classname) and specified using #<idname> in css file
    attribute selectors select elements having the same attribute

    we added id: product overview and plans for two section tags 
    we added class: section-title for h1 tag inside plan section 

    Now, in our css we have a h1 selector and .section-title which is a class for h1 under plan section
    CSS Specifity rules will be used to resolve such conflict
    Note that font-family will still be used from h1 selector and not browser defaults
    CSS Specifity order lowest to highest priority:
        <tag> and ::pseudo-element selectors
        .class and :pseudo-class and [attribute] selectors
        #id selectors
        inline styles
        there are some other rules too like inheritance
    we repeat the h1 selector with only the default san-serif font 
        the h1 selector appearing last is applied among the two h1 selectors
