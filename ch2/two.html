    First method to add css to html:
        Aim: Style the section element
        Method: Adding inline style attribute
        Procedure: Add style attribute to the section element
        Details: 
            style is a normal HTML attribute which can be added to an HTML element
            css declaration is added to style attribute
            this declaration has property and value
        Conclusion: This method is avoided since it becomes hard to read when more properties are added
