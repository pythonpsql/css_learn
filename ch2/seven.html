<!-- 
Changes made after six.html
    we added * selector at the bottom of css and set font-family to sans-serif
    it did not change the fonts because it had lower priority than h1 selector as seen in Console
    it is also an inefficient way to change any property since it has to parse every element in the page 
    now we try to style body which wraps many other elements contained inside it
    when body was used to change font-family, it still did not work
    inheritance has specifity lower than browser defaults, so it failed to change h1 fonts

    we added p tag in plans section
    and we see that the font specified in body selector was used
