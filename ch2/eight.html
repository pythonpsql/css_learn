    Q. How to ensure 'Choose your plan' h1 tag does not get the 
    same style as h1 tag in product-overview section?
    A. We get same style because of h1 selector in product-overview section. 
       We want the default style.

       First method: set property font-family to inherit 
       It basically increases the specificity priority of inheritance for that property

       Second method: assign class or id to h1 under product-overview
       class:
       Not a good idea since it won't be reused.
       Create a class only if it's reusable
       id:
       Semantically, not a good idea since we are already under an id

       Third method: combinator
       we change current h1 to #product-overview h1        
       we can enclose h1 in a <div> only to confirm that h1 does not have to be a child but merely a descendant

        Additional, if we now re-introduce h1 tag at the bottom of the table
            it wouldn't be applied because #product-overview h1 has higher specifity
            it would be applied to 'Choose your plan' h1
            #product-overview h1 is more specific than simply h1
            the more specific rule has higher specificity than less specific rule
        Note that combinator has nothing to do with inheritance, 
            the background of #product-overview h1 is not the same as #product-overview
